This is a small snipbit of code I worked on to test how well SetFit and an active learning approach would work for classifying a data set with a large imbalance in distribution.

We combined all the "Physical Transformations" sub-categories into one "Looks/Body" category to give us a larger working data set.

From this we were able to create a more balanced training data set.

We found great success with this method, and are experimenting with the limits of this strategy particularly in its ability to multi-label the sub-categories.

This code has been adjusted to remove any sensitive data or outputs.
